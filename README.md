The purpose of these scripts, written originally in gdscript for the Godot game engine, is for me (and others, if they so choose) to be able to apply "boilerplate"; that is, general code that is common enough to be considered a given in most contexts.
For example, running, jumping, and attacking are all common things in games. The goal of these scripts is to abstract these functions for general drag-and-drop use in game projects. From there, they can be modified to suit the needs of the developer(s)
to better suit his/her/their games.
